<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project
This is a small project to help you understand what a Plain
text password is and how can you use coldfusion to improve
the security for it. Well at least to know what coldfusion has
to offer in this area. This small project holds some examples
to help you on your way.

## Getting Started

First you have to download and install commandbox. Links for this are right 
[here](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download). Its github 
repo is right [here](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/commandbox). After having 
it installed, open up your editor (I used vscode) in an empty folder and open
commandbox in its terminal view.

1. on the empty folder and in the `bash terminal` to clone this repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BalbinoOrtus/plain-text-blog-examples.git
    ```

2. vscode/commandbox terminal: to move to the repo folder
    ```sh
    cd plain-text-blog-examples
    ```

3. vscode/commandbox terminal: to start the server
    ```sh
    server start
    ```
    or
